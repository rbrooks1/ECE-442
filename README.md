Multimedia Signal processing and Machine Learning Techniques

Glossary:

PCA:  A lab focussed on dimensionality reduction and reconstruction of images using the PCA unsupervised learning technique

Classification: a lab focussed on using linear classification modelling and K Nearest Neighbours to predict where test images fall given training data

Background and Foreground Pixel Detection:  Using Mixture of Gaussian modelling to extract the foreground and background pixels from a video

Neural Networks:  Using neural networks to determine head poses of an image.

Note: for neural networks, this lab was done in partnership with Hauwei and as such most of the code was given to us pre written.
      We were also given access to their development kits which have AI already trained on them.
